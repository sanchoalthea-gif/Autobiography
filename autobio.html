        I was born on July 14, 2000, and my life has been shaped by love, discipline, and necessity. 
        Today I am married with two beautiful sons, and we navigate daily moments that teach resilience, gratitude, and hope. 
        My childhood memories are vivid not because they were easy, but because they forged who I am. 
        I grew up under the strict guidance of my parents, and I learned early that rules could be a path to something better. 
        Their expectations honed my character, teaching me to persevere even when the road seemed hard. 
        I carried a quiet ache from those early spankings, yet I also carried a stubborn spark—an inner resolve to prove that I could become more than my circumstances.

        A pivotal turning point came with the realization that I was pregnant. 
        That moment forced me to pause my studies and reorient my plans toward the needs of a growing family. 
        The Covid-19 era intensified those challenges, compelling me to work so I could provide for us. 
        I began as a call center agent, a demanding role that tested my patience and sharpened my resolve. 
        It was difficult at first: the long hours, the constant questions, the emotional labor. 
        Yet each day I learned something new—about multitasking, about staying calm under pressure, and about listening with empathy. 
        Those small victories accumulated into a deeper confidence: I was capable of more than I had imagined.

        Education taught me lessons beyond textbooks. It offered a framework for resilience and a belief in continual growth. 
        Every subject added tools to face real-world tasks, and I came to see schooling not merely as obligation but as preparation for responsibility. 
        This realization fueled my ambition to pursue Information Technology. 
        I want to master this field because technology shapes our lives and holds the promise of empowering families like mine.

        The most influential people in my life are those who believed in me: God, my parents, my husband, and especially my children. 
        They have nurtured me into someone who strives daily to be better: braver in the face of uncertainty, kinder in moments of fatigue, and more compassionate toward others' struggles. 
        They remind me that strength often reveals itself in the quiet, persistent choices—the decision to show up, the courage to start again, and the curiosity to learn.

        If there is a single takeaway I wish to share, it is this: life is a blend of struggle and purpose. 
        My journey is not a dramatic ascent but a steady climb—moments of doubt met with acts of love, challenges met with resolve, and learning that becomes a foundation for tomorrow. 
        I am grateful for where I began, proud of where I am, and hopeful for the future I am building for my family and myself.
